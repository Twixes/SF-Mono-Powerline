![SF Mono Powerline](Prompt.png)

### Apple's gorgeous SF Mono font patched with [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher) for Powerline support

Powerline glyphs allow for pretty and practical statuslines, as seen in [the original vim plugin](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) or in enhanced shell prompts like [Shellder](https://github.com/simnalamburt/shellder) (shown above) or [Starship](https://starship.rs).

Supported for macOS, Linux and Windows.

For personal use only.

#### Installation

Get it with Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
brew install --cask font-sf-mono-for-powerline
```

Or install manually by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/Twixes/SF-Mono-Powerline/releases/latest).
